⋅⋅*The bug was that the input type of num1 and num2 is string. So the + in the function is actually doing a string concatenation of num1 and num2. Thus, the type of result is a string with num1 following with num2.
⋅⋅*I would fix it with changing the type of num1 and num2 before calculating their sum.

```javascript
function calculateSum(num1, num2) {
    num1 = Number(num1);
    num2 = Number(num2);
    let result = num1 + num2
    return result
}
```
